		After seemingly countless hours of pain, this thing is finally up and running. wew... Well now that this is taken care of I guess I will run down what you can probably expect me to be posting on here. I will most likely keep the topics programming/technology centric, however I may discuss other things as well if I feel like it (I don't really have much of a plan tbh). As far as tonight goes, I was planning to write up a synopsis about the video I posted this morning talking about how for a general use case, what programming language you write in doesn't really matter. I'm pretty gassed after setting this all up so I will save that for another time. Anyways, I will try to post updates here as often as I can.
