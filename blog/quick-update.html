	I have done a terrible job keeping this updated over the past few weeks so I wanted to give a quick update. I have been pretty busy lately with work and have been working on a few posts but have canned a lot of them since I wasn't really happy with where they went. As far as working on the website I am still doing it. There are a few features that I am currently working on and hopfully they will be added soon. Recently I have added a "/contents" page with links to some PDF documents that I have written. To recap some of the events that I have missed in the blog. 2 weeks ago I unretired from speedrunning and participated in NASA's speedkino marathon where I ran Metal Slug 5 and Etrian Odyssey III. This past weekend I went to Toronto to visit some friends who go to UoT. This upcoming weekend I will be attending PAX East with a friend from BC. If anyone reading this wants to meet up, Send me an email.
