	Something that has been on my mind recently is the general outcry of traditionalist media types over the past few years toward those who frequent online image board websites and forums. This response by those who have grown up without these types of communities is quite interesting to me since I have grown up in a world where these modern outlets have been available to me since I became a denizen of the online world. In this blog post, I hope to explore what drives this response to less mainstream forms of media outlets.

	<li>What Diffentiates A Classic Image Board From Other Forum-like Sites?</li>
		<p>
			When I talk about image boards I am most often refering to the chanstyle sitesthat populate the internet today such as 4chan, 8chan, etc. Some people like to compare a site like 4chan to Reddit. While both have their similarities such as 4chans' boards and Reddit's subreddits, they are very much different in the way the user interacts with the site. Reddit offeres a much more personal relationship between its users. Similar to modern social media, everyone has a profile where you can see their past posts, interests, and personal information. This is one of the main differences between the two as 4chan lacks any formal means of connecting between users. One of the main features of 4chan is that all users, by default, are anonymous. On Reddit a user can make long lasting connections with others while on 4chan, most likely, your interation with another user lives and dies on the thread you are on. Another area where we see a differing design philosophy between Reddit and 4chan is the way posts are interacted with. On Reddit there is a system of upvoting and downvoting posts based on if you agree or disagree with the content. The way a post gets the attention of mass audiances on Reddit is by garnering support in the form of upvotes. 4chan has no such system. Instead 4chan posts get attention based on user response. In order to make a post that gets to the top of a board and reach more people, you have to post something that provokes people to post responces to your post. There is no system of Likes or Upvotes as seen in forms of social media. These two seemingly small differences drastically alter the content created on both sites. Where the main goal of a Reddit post is to optimize the ammount of Upvotes your post garners, the goal of a 4chan post is to spark discussion and get as many replies as possible. I believe that these are the defining aspects that keep 4chan surrounded in controversy, but they can also be viewed as the strongest points to using them.

	<li>Controversial Points Of Image Boards</li>
		<p>
			Those who oppose the use of image boards often site that their use often breeds hateful content due to the anonymity of the userbase. Often these detractors will cherrypick content from boards like /pol/ and declare that the entirity of 4chan is not only relegated to these communities but also as a collective believe in these ideas. Much like any sweeping generalization of this type, the whole is being conflated with the ideas perpetuated by a small fringe sector.
